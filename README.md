# California Housing Price Prediction

## ðŸ“‘ Summary
The **California Housing Price Prediction** app uses machine learning to predict house prices in California based on various features such as median income, house age, average rooms, and more. The app employs a **Random Forest Regressor** model, which is trained using the well-known **California Housing dataset** from scikit-learn. Users can input values for different features through an interactive sidebar, and the app will predict the house price based on these inputs. The model's performance is also evaluated with metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)**, and feature importance is visualized for better model interpretability.

## ðŸ“š Overview
This project utilizes **Streamlit** for the front-end interface and **scikit-learn** for building the machine learning pipeline. The goal is to predict house prices in California using the provided dataset and allow users to interact with the model by inputting different parameters such as median income, average rooms, and geographical data.

### Key Features:
- **Predict Housing Prices**: Input various features to predict house prices in California.
- **Model Evaluation**: Displays performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizes which features are most important in the model's predictions.
